# ðŸŒ‰ Bridge Load Capacity Predictor

This web application uses an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to predict the maximum load (in tons) that a bridge can carry. It is designed as part of the ENCE 2530 Lab 11 assignment.

## ðŸ“Š Overview

- Trained on a dataset containing bridge characteristics
- Uses a TensorFlow-based ANN model
- Includes preprocessing with scaling and one-hot encoding
- Deployed with Streamlit for user interaction

## ðŸ”§ Features

- Inputs:
  - Span (ft)
  - Deck width (ft)
  - Age (years)
  - Number of lanes
  - Condition rating (1â€“9)
  - Material type
- Outputs:
  - Predicted maximum load capacity in **tons**

## ðŸš€ Deployment

The app is deployed using Streamlit Cloud.

**Live App**: [your-app-link.streamlit.app](https://your-app-link.streamlit.app)
